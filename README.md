# JavaScript3DEngine

This project is intended to explore the application of Academic Math Theory to Game & 3D Web Design.

Specifically, by creating a simple 3D Engine that will

- render 3D shapes in an HTML canvas using javascript
- render 2D projection of various 3D shapes
- provide mechanisms for user interaction with the shapes


Tesseract Branch is a 4D to 2D projection of a rotating hypercube (Work in Progress)
