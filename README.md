# JavaScript3DEngine

Developing a simple 3d Engine to render 3d shapes in an HTML canvas using javascript. Goal is to be able to render 2D projection of various 3D shapes and be able to interact with them. 

The reason I'm developing this is because of its potential applications for game design, 3D web design and because it's cool to apply math theory i've learned in school

Teseract Branch is a 4D to 2D projection of a rotating hypercube
